title:  "Want to work on Amanda?"

I've
 not made any secret of the fact that I want more people hacking on
Amanda.  This is both for selfish reasons -- many hands make light work
-- and for altruistic reasons -- a broader community of developers can
provide better governance for the project and long-term continuity.
With a few noticable exceptions, I haven't had a lot of satisfaction.

I
think part of the reason is that Amanda has a steep learning curve, even
 within the new Perl code.  The time to climb that curve is a big
investment, and folks with only a small itch to scratch can't afford it.

In an
 effort to sweeten the pot, we (Zmanda) are offering to pay for flexible
 work on Amanda.  Part-time or full-time, on your own schedule.  Your
choice of projects.  Support and gratitude from the other hackers.  And
the option to become a full Zmanda employee if that's your bent.

Here are some possible projects, to pique your interest:

*   MySQL application (to round out the set with <tt>[ampgsql](http://code.v.igoro.us/archives/50-Whats-New-in-Amanda-Postgres-Backups.html)</tt>)
*   [Cyrus Imapd](http://cyrusimap.web.cmu.edu/) application (gnutar doesn't deal well with the application's tiny files and hard links)
*   OpenSSL for network transport, using certificates and keys for authentication
*   Database-backed backup catalog
*   Amvault upgrade
*   Handle Logical EOM (LEOM) on all devices that support it, drastically reducing the number of parts Amanda writes
*   Support for more cloud backends than just S3
*   Parallel writes to multiple devices

If you're interested, contact me (<tt>dustin@zmanda.com</tt>) and we'll work something out!

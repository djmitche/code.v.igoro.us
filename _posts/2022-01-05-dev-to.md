I've not been posting here very frequently, for which I apologize.
I will get back to doing so, but I am also experimenting with blogging on `dev.to`.
I've begun two series there, which you may wish to check out:

 * [Software Engineering as Engineering](https://dev.to/djmitche/software-engineering-as-engineering-a-series-43l4)
 * [Lessons in Language Design from Go](https://dev.to/djmitche/lessons-in-language-design-from-go-a-series-4g64)

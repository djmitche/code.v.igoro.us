Every girl gets the memo:

    To: Girls
    From: The Establishment
    Re: Math

    Math is hard, and you'll never need it anyway.
    You'll just be cooking and making babies, after all.

    cc: Boys

But most teen girls, being the modern anti-establishment type, reject this
sentiment as "the man" trying to keep them down.  They look to the female role
models around them for guidance as to what "real life" is like.  That comes
down to teachers, moms, aunties, and big sisters.

Last week, while I was working on an algebra problem with a group of 7th-grade
girls, the classroom teacher (a woman) said, "I'm not good at math."

    Re: Math

    I never learned math, and now I'm a teacher, so you can safely ignore it.

But what did this teacher really mean?  She can solve the problem we were
working on, no problem.  What's hard is _teaching_ math.  As with most
subjects, a teacher needs to be agile enough to dance around the math,
attacking it from all angles, spotting the misconceptions and shreds of
understanding in a student's responses, and asking the right questions.

That's legitimately hard, and I think it's unreasonable to ask someone to be
this good at more than one subject.  I'm a pretty OK math teacher, but if you
plop me down in front of a language arts class, I'll struggle.  I'm OK with
that, but the proper phrase is "I'm not good at teaching language arts," not "I
can't read."

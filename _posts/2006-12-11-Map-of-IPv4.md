[This](http://xkcd.com/c195.html) is from a web comic, but it's a genius way to
lay out the IP space.  I particularly like the way you can see the outlines of
the old classful divisions, and get a good feel for what portion has been
allocated.  I'm also amused that companies (like Google over on the left) are
just specks.

I gave a talk at PuppetConf last week entitled "Infrastructure as Software".
The gist of it is that Puppet is a programming language, and in order to grow our "Infrastructure as Code" beyond a few thousand lines we need to adopt techniques from software development.
I used [PuppetAgain](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/PuppetAgain) as an example throughout (both of good practices and areas for improvement).

The slides are [hosted here](/files/infrastructure-as-software).
As usual with my talks, the slides themselves may not be very useful to you, as they serve only as touchstones for the interesting stuff that I say.
Puppet Labs will have a full recording of the presentation up soon; see [the notification signup](http://info.puppetlabs.com/puppetconf-2014-videos-notification.html) for now.

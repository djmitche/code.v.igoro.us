I love reading old computer science texts.  I own the first three volumes of <u>The Art Of Computer Programming</u>,
 and while I can't claim to have read them all cover-to-cover, I often
flip through them fairly randomly, and usually find some clever
algorithmic trick or optimization that piques my interest.

Somehow I hadn't heard about [HAKMEM](http://www.inwap.com/pdp10/hbaker/hakmem/hakmem.html) before.  It's an entirely _new_ trove of puzzles to think about!

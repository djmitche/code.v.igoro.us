(from a comment on [Zen and the Art of Nonprofit Technology](http://www.zenofnptech.org/2009/08/diversity-and-open-source.html))

I've
realized recently that open-source projects have developed a class
structure.  First, consider the broad middle-class of little-known but
functional projects that have a number of users and several developers
(Amanda, Buildbot, Cfengine, Sphinx, Curl, the autoconf archive, maybe
GMT).  Above these projects are the superprojects that nearly everyone
uses and that have hundreds of contributors (Firefox, Linux, Python,
Perl, to name a few).  These are all islands in a squalid sea of
abandonware and single-developer projects -- we've all got one or two,
right?

What
are the keys to mobility between these classes?  What factors might keep
 an otherwise-deserving project in the lower or middle classes?

I just stumbled on Ted T'so's [Organic vs. Non-Organic Open Source, Revisited](http://thunk.org/tytso/blog/2008/04/26/organic-vs-non-organic-open-source-revisited/).
  The distinction is that an organic open source community has a diverse
 development community, in terms of motivations or, more concretely,
employers.  Conversely, a non-organic community is dominated by
developers from a single company.

This
has put words to a question I've been wrestling with for a long time.
In any community, those who do the most work have the strongest voices
and the most power.  As someone who knows his way around the Amanda
codebase, I hold the fate of a user's feature request in my hands: if I
like it, I can implement it, and if I don't, it will be relegated to the
 dusty archives of the amanda-users list.  Similarly, when I make a
proposal, non-developers must respond in a subordinate voice: "well, I
won't be writing it, but I think .."  This is not due to any malice on
my part, but simply a fact of the relationship of consumer to producer.

The
bulk of Amanda development is currently performed by Zmanda employees.
That's a simple fact that Ohloh can verify for you.  That makes the
Amanda development community non-organic, in Ted's terminology.  In
Raymond's terms, we're all cathedral and no bazaar.  As Ted points out,
this can be a good thing -- I think that we do great work, and that we
go out of our way to listen and respond to the user community's ideas
and requests.  A tight group of developers can move quickly, and
consensus decisions are easier and less time-consuming.  However, power
corrupts, and I would _like_ to have other developers out there to tell me, "no," or, "I have a better way," occasionally.

But how?

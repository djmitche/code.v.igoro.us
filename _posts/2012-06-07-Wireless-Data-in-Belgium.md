In hopes this will be useful to others:

I
have an unlocked AT&T phone (Samsung Galaxy Nexus), and needed a
data plan in Belgium (Brussels, specifically).  I really don't intend to
 text or talk, but data is important.  Most of the news kiosks are happy
 to sell you a SIM, but with no data portion.

A
fellow Mozillian, Ben Kero, recommended BASE wireless.  There was a spot
 in the airport, but they were out of SIMs.  I borrowed some wifi,
looked up another location on [base.be](http://www.base.be/), and went there.

They
have a 1-GB plan for 15€, called "surf & mail 15".  What you'll get
is a 15€ SIM card with 15€ credit on it, and a brochure giving
instructions to send a text message to activate the 15€ plan using that
credit.  When I did so, I immediately received a text indicating I did
not have sufficient credit, but the data seems to work.

Which is good, because the wifi in the apartment we're staying at is pretty poor.

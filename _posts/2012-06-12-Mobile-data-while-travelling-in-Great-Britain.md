Three
 wireless was recommended for my trip here, but they were out of SIMs
(which seems a common malady), so I dropped by the T-Mobile store.  They
 set me up with a Â£5 SIM with unlimited data for 30 days, which seemed
great.  But read on.

As I
walked out the door of the shop, I went to look up bars in Edinburgh,
and was presented with a "prove you're 18 with a credit card" form,
courtesy T-Mobile.  Of course, I don't have a UK credit card, so I
turned around and walked back into the shop.  They fixed this up without
 any additional trouble -- but there would have been more trouble had I
not immediately looked for something not "child-safe" (Which brings up
the recurring question: what on earth have legislators been smoking to
think that children should not be able to visit breweries' and bars'
websites?  Do they think that the "series of tubes" can, in the hands of
 n'er-do-wells, carry grain alcohol straight to the mouths of babes?).

I subsequently noticed that they block IRC - not such a big deal, since they do not block SSH, which is how I usually use IRC.

And
now that I'm on my laptop and not my mobile, I notice that they are also
 injecting their JavaScript into every (non-SSL) page I visit, helpfully
 shrinking images and adding keyboard shortcuts to un-shrink them.  And
probably capturing passwords, too.  Lovely.  I'm sure they're doing so
to "protect" me.

For
the moment, I'm really only using the data to figure out where to go
next, and what to drink when I get there, and only for a few days.  Even
 so, this intrusion into my privacy galls me.

Steer clear of T-Mobile, if you value your online life.

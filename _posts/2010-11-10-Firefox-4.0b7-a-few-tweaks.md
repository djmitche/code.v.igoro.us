The
 new beta of Firefox 4.0 was released today.  I'm not quite willing to
run Minefield (nightlies), so I've been eagerly awaiting this beta to
fix some nagging but not show-stopper bugs in 4.0b6\.  One of those
involved bad interactions of App Tabs with Panorama.  Now the app tabs
nicely decorate the side of each tab set in the panorama view.

Another
 nice thing is that the Option-Space key combination, which opened
panorama in 4.0b6, no longer does so.  That's OK - I found that to be
too easy to press anyway.  It's now bound to Command-E (right there at
the top of the "View" menu).

Panorama
 has also been re-bound to swipe-up and swipe-down, which makes me less
happy.  In most apps on the Mac, those swipes are equivalent to the
"Home" and "End" keystrokes -- they scroll to the top or bottom of the
current page.  So with a little help from my new co-workers, I
discovered the settings to fix that.

The full list of gesture bindings is [written up here](http://t.tal.by/post/95428783/changing-firefox-gestures), but the two I needed to change are `browser.gesture.swipe.up` and `.down`.  The scrolling commands to bind to them are `cmd_scrollTop` and `cmd_scrollBottom`.

4.0 has a number of other great UI enhancements, too.  I'm excited to see 4.0 finally released!

If
 you're looking for info on CustomSettings.ini, you're most likely to
find questions answered with "try this script".  You type it in, and if
it works, great; if not, keep looking.  It's well-nigh impossible to
find actual documentation, and the programming-by-INI-sections design is
 not exactly intuitive.

It
turns out there's some in the help docs for the MDT, but those are a
.CHM file and Microsoft apparently doesn't post those online.

However, some helpful (Russian?) souls have done so.  Behold: [MicrosoftÂ® Deployment Toolkit 2012 Toolkit Reference](http://systemscenter.ru/mdt2012.en/toolkitreference.htm).

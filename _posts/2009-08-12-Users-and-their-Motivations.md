I stumbled upon a summary of the Drefyus model of skill acquisition by Andrew Hunt today, copied out of the powerpoint [here](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000203.html).  There's a bullet point in there that I hadn't seen before:

1.  Level 1: Beginner
 *   Little or no previous experience
  *   **Doesn't want to learn: wants to accomplish a goal**
  *   No discretionary judgement
  *   Rigid adherence to rules

I've been toying with the idea of a beginner's guide to [Amanda](http://amanda.org/)
 for some time.  My vision was of a shallow but broad description of how
 Amanda fits together: clients and servers, applications, holding disks,
 changers, devices, and so on.  Scaffolding, in the constructivist
sense.  The intent was to head off some of the more ignorant questions
about Amanda, and give beginners a base on which to build their own
Amanda configurations.

But
this won't work!  A beginner does not want to learn, and anything that
tries to "teach" a beginner is just so much noise to him or her.  In
fact, most beginner guides are nothing of the sort -- they are probably
only useful to those already at level 2.

This
 is all the more the case with Amanda: like plumbing, Amanda users just
want backups to happen so they can concentrate on their core business,
so even smart folks will happily remain at level 1 if they can make it
work.  So what can we do to support these users?  And how can we
encourage people to move to the next level?

I'm
 watching the DNC's Rules & Bylaws Committee meeting, discussing the
 fate of the Michigan and Florida delegations.  This committee consists
of the elite among the Democratic superdelegates.  These are all
powerful, intelligent, important people (including the wonderful Donna
Brazile).

What
 has me upset is that I've now heard two women explain that they don't
have the "mathematical genius" to work out the proper representation for
 these states; no men have made such a declaration.  First of all,
that's bull: anyone can work out what 33% of 128 is.  The difficult part
 is in the politics, and everyone on this committee is an expert on
politics.

More
 importantly, though: why is it OK for these women to brag about their
mathematical ignorance?  What message does this send to PoliSci students
 struggling through calculus?  One of the women to mention this was
Alice Travis Germond, who was a VP of NARAL -- hardly an advocate of
keeping women barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen.  What is she
thinking?

[UPDATE] The other woman to brag about her innumeracy was Tina Flournoy -- Gore's finance director!  Finance!

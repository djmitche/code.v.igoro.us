There
 have been a few interesting sites popping up lately to do some
large-scale analysis of open source applications and the developers
behind them.  [ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/) is one such
site.  Ohloh analyzes the source to extract license and language
information, and also looks at the relative contributions of various
authors, based on commits.

The [Amanda report](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/5128?p=Amanda) shows some warnings:

*   Small development team

*   Short source control history

The first is something I'd like to change -- if you're looking for an open source project, have I got a deal for you!

The
second is actually an artifact of the switch to Subversion -- a much
longer history is available in SourceForge's CVS repository, but when
the project switch to subversion, it was imported in a single revision,
rather than using cvs2svn.

EDIT: fix typo in the title

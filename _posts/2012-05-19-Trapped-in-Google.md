Whenever
 I search in Aurora on my phone, I'm taken to a stripped-down version of
 the page with the header "this page adapted for your browser".

How
do I fix this?  I'd rather fix it with a Google preference, but barring
that I expect that Firefox has a way for me to regain control of my
online experience?

title:  "Subscribe to a google group with a different address?"

Google
 Groups is one place where, IMHO, Google pushes its hegemony too far,
making it difficult to use.  I wanted to subscribe to puppet-users with
my Mozilla address, but since I have a Google account, Groups assumes I
want to subscribe with that address.  No!

I found the fix with a bit of Googling (some irony there).  It involves editing a URL:

> http://groups.google.com/group/puppet-users/boxsubscribe?email=email@domain.com

where you'd substitute the name of the group you want for _puppet-users_ and add your email at the end.

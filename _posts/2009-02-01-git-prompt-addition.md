Now that I'm using git all the time, it's helpful to have bash show me what
branch I'm on, and whether the working directory is dirty.  I found a [gist by
Henrik Nyh](http://henrik.nyh.se/2008/12/git-dirty-prompt) that does just this.
I souped it up a little bit to be more efficient and handle a few extra
situations.  Here's the result: [EDIT: I have updated this gist since this post
was made; the current version is based on git-completion.sh in the git
distribution]

Please use it if you like, and fork the gist if you make any improvements!

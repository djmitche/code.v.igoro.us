I
 try not to do web development anymore, but it's hard to avoid.  I just
encountered some CSS weirdness with (brace yourself) IE7, and wanted to
look at what the CSS actually said, so I clicked "Show Web Inspector" on
 Safari's "Debug" menu.  I was completely blown away by [the result](http://weblogs.asp.net/davidbarkol/archive/2007/06/22/web-inspector-for-safari-on-windows.aspx).
  The tool has a very intuitive DOM viewer, which shows everything you
could want to know about a node, and also hilights the result
beautifully in the original page.  The "Network" icon shows a great view
 of the load time for the page, helping to diagnose all of those slow
loads.  And the "Console" icon gives warnings from the XML/HTML parser!
 All those little typos that go unnoticed on all but one version of one
obscure browser?  Safari will actually tell you about them!

This is how you build a developer tool.  Wow.
